# FLIGHT_DELAY_PREDICTION

# Problem

Airlines, airports, and passengers can all become quite frustrated by flight delays. In addition, the complexity of flight data for air transportation made it particularly challenging to construct precise prediction models for flight delays. In this research, we attempt to find a solution using methods for creating models for predicting flight delays using machine learning techniques.
